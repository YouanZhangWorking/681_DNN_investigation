# Output mode & paths
# -------------------------------

# Output mode that selects generated file types:
#   rom - output auto-generated C source (.c\.h) and DNN memory image (.bin)
#         (intended for model that is compiled into firmware as ROM model)
#   i2c - output i2c sequence to load this model on a real sensor via i2c (.bin)
#         Also for simulation.
OUTPUT_MODE i2c

# Directory to store all generated files in
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ..\output

# Optional: If the model contains a state tensor that persists from frame-to-frame,
# the following parameters must be set:
#   MODEL_STATE_READ_BUFFER_ID - the buffer ID (from summary.txt) of the tensor that
#                                uses the state as an input
#   MODEL_STATE_WRITE_BUFFER_ID - the buffer ID (from summary.txt) of the tensor that
#                                updates the state variable as an output
MODEL_STATE_READ_BUFFER_ID 27
MODEL_STATE_WRITE_BUFFER_ID 28
